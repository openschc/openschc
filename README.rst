What is OpenSCHC ?
==================

OpenSCHC
--------

OpenSCHC is a OpenSource Implementation of SCHC (Static Context Header Compression) standardized at the IETF by the `LPWAN Working Group <https://tools.ietf.org/wg/lpwan/>`_ as `RFC8724 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8724>`_. Oversimplifying, this is essentially IP protocol headers compression and fragmentation so that they can be transported by low datarate, long range IoT networks.

The long term goal is to have a stable, open-source, reference Python3 codebase for the SCHC protocol.

.. OpenSCHC is developed to be compatible with micropython, on the device side.
